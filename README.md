## Java Web Application Customization Example
This project aims to give an example project for customizations around 52Â°North Java Web applications . The actual goal is to show how the code base can be used within a customized context. By using Maven configuration and modules can be interchanged and adjusted. Furthermore the customized project can be put in a separate repository without leaving track of further improvements, features and bugfixes on the current root project.
